# Tech for good near you

## What

An app to help users find `Tech for good` events. Events will be filterable by date, area of interest and location. They will be displayed on a map along with the user's location.

## Why

Currently `Tech for good` events are publicised in a range of mediums such as Twitter, MeetUp and Eventbrite. This makes it hard for interested people to get informed about all the events going on.

## How

Event data is pulled in from the Meetup API and a collection of user submitted events. The app combines all the event data and displays events in a clean, intuitive interface.

Users can enter their postcode or get their current location, select which date range they'd like to see events from and then see a list of all the events near them plus a map showing where these events are.

The app is built with:

* Elm - (frontend)
* Tachyons - (frontend)
* Elixir / Phoenix - (backend)


## Submit your event

visit https://tech-for-good-near-you.herokuapp.com/user-event/new and add your event, our moderators will look over the events and approve them to be displayed.
